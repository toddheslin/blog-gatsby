Aside from settling into the change of culture, food, and weather here is what I've been working on.\n\n- Becoming an [Linchpin][2] in the field of Data Analytics\n    - **Why**: unless you've been living under a rock (sometimes I contemplate the merits of this), big data is here to stay. My concern is these data will be used for evil instead of for good.\n    - **How**: I use data science to help people deeply understand their customers, primarily focusing on customer lifetime value.\n    - **Progress**: currently working with the amazing team at [Switch Digital][3] and building products that help us build brand relationships.\n- Building my full-stack programming toolkit:\n    - **Why**: I studied economics, not computer science. This was a choice of convenience. Although has the years passed, I've yearned for a technical and creative expression of my thinking. It turns out that I absolutely love programming. \n    - **How**: combining with my work in data analytics, I'm going deep into the PostgreSQL flavour of SQL, and Javascript across all environments. This includes adding interactivity on websites, building full-stack web applications, and creating data-processing utilities.\n    - **Progress**: about one-third of my time at my computer is programming, this is about 70 hours per month as of the month of June 2017. Whilst a lot of this time is on personal and client projects, I'd like to contribute more to open source projects. This will force me to learn more from others.\n- Writing prestige car rental reviews at [Ride Hacks][1]\n    - **Why**: personal transport is economically inefficient, public transport is underfunded in countries where driving is 'normal', and driving experiences enable transformative traveling adventures.\n    - **How**: removing the barriers to great driving experiences and matching drivers to unique experiences.\n    - **Progress**: Ride Hacks has been running for a few years now. However, I haven't contributed any new content in the last 12 months.

Although we have never met, his books, audiobooks and blog have been a compass for me over many years.\n\nThis podcast, although unedited and unpolished, is an extraordinary insight into Seth's thoughts about startups. Seth's welcome message sums up the purpose of the three-day workshop, with featured content within the five-hour podcast.\n\nSeth's welcome message:\n\n> *In the summer of 2012, I had an amazing opportunity to spend three days with a group of extremely motivated entrepreneurs. People right at the beginning of building their project, launching their organization. During those three days, I took them on a guided tour of some of the questions they were going to have to wrestle with, some of the difficult places they were going to strand up and say \"this is me, this is what I'm making\".*\n\n \n\n## WHAT HAS INSPIRED ME (AND MAY INSPIRE YOU TOO)\n\n*In this section of the post I'm going to highlight a few insights that have inspired me along with a short riff of my own thoughts. Some of these insights may inspire me to write another blog post specifically on that topic. In this case, I'll edit this post that you're reading and link you to the new blog post. Enjoy.*\n\n### [Decide whether you'll be a freelancer or an entrepreneur.](http://beingremarkable.me/freelancer-or-entrepreneur-seth-godin-cares-and-so-should-you)\n\nThe distinction is critical because the emotional cost is high if you think you're one type and act like the other. In its simplest form, a freelancer rents themselves out to someone else to perform valuable emotional labour, whereas an entrepreneur organizes resources (people, connections, capital, time) to build something bigger than themselves.\n\n### [Marketing is telling a story about the value you create for people.](http://beingremarkable.me/marketing-and-telling-stories-seth-godins-startup-school)\n\nThere is an art and science to marketing. There are courses, books and consultants who teach the science (4-P's, market segmentation….yada…yada…yada). However no matter the execution, if the story doesn't resonate with the tribe you're connecting with there will be no transfer of emotion. They will feel nothing, they won't respond, you'll be ignored. Perhaps this happens when we try market to the masses instead of selecting our tribe. It's easy to ignore someone you walk by in the middle of Sydney, but much harder if it's in Antarctica.\n\n### If you're in B2B sales, your prospect only has one decision to make: \"Would this purchase deliver a good story to please my boss? or will I get fired?\"\n\nI've been on both ends of the conversation: the buyer and the seller. This was something that I never realised and is an incredible insight into where you should focus your time. As someone with a story to tell to another business, you can get that message to CEOs, VPs and middle managers through different channels. You can't ring up the CEO and pitch an idea like you could do with a middle manager. However you can equally build trust in the organization with an investment of time to work out the networking events where these CEOs and VPs meet up. Buy a few minutes of stage time to simply tell your story and don't even think of selling anything on that night.\n\nNow you've got the ability to say to the manager *\"Why don't you have a chat to the VP or CEO, they've heard me tell this story before.\"* If you're bad at story telling, you didn't build trust with the audience or they don't have the problem that you can solve, you're not going to get any further. However you'll be able to control the process if you're respecting the hierarchy and putting the story before your pitch.\n\n### The job isn't to find more customers for your products but to find more products for your customers.\n\nThis is at the heart of tribe leadership thinking. If you're putting your contribution to the tribe before your interest in making money from its members, those who you serve will trust you. Alternatively, if you're trying to find more members to fit existing products, you will make compromises on who you will sell to and reduce the value and sentiment within the tribe.\n\nLet's say that your tribe is people with tribal tattoos and you have a photo gallery website for all members to post their tattoos for others to comment on. To make money, you have products where you collect affiliate commissions. To make more money the calculation is: more members = more unique page views = more clicks on affiliate links = more money in the bank. Here's the twist: If you simply accept anyone, whether they have a tribal tattoo or not, you're going to be attracting the *wrong* sort of people that tribal tattoo people want to hang out with. Bad move. You're better off charging the members a $10 monthly subscription, stack the value offered, and explicitly keep people out unless they are worthy of being a member. Customers before products.\n\n### What's the hard part of your business? If you don't have a hard part, you don't have a business. Spend all of your time on this.\n\nThere are so many easy parts of your business. If you're about to do something, it will fall into these three categories: planning, organizing or contributing. From my personal experience, as well as through advising other entrepreneurs, the first two parts are easy and that's where many spend their time. **Wrong move.** Way too often will an entrepreneur spend their time planning what to do and organizing things. These are activities that should be a) minimized and then b) outsourced. This is why you hire a CEO, CFO and COO right? Contribute to your business by spending time on asking and answering the hard questions.\n\n### The problem isn't that someone is copying, it's that not enough people are copying. This helps share the message across the tribes. If you have it right and focus on a remarkable product experience, you will win.\n\nWe humans are indeed funny. Too often we act like we're one of the many inventors of the light bulb instead of like Thomas Edison who commercialised the electricity grid. From my experience with [Apathco Group,](http://www.apathco.com.au/) our biggest problem wasn't that we would lose a customer to a competitor, it was that we would lose a customer to *inaction*. We found that more competition in the marketplace actually helped us stand out as experts and could tell a more compelling story to our niche.\n\n### What have you built into your assumptions that you could skip to help scale successfully while still being scarce and remarkable?\n\nAs was the focus in [Seth's Purple Cow,](http://beingremarkable.me/inspiration) **scarcity creates value.** As a freelancer, what is the most scarce resource that you have? Your time. If your time is scarce, that means you are scarce. But being scarce isn't good enough. What's the difference between earning $12 per hour and $1200 per hour? How remarkable you are to me.\n\nWhen you're remarkable, people talk about you. They tell your story and it spreads amongst the tribe. When you're remarkable, more people want you. This creates demand but your supply is constant at 10 hours per day (or week). The more remarkable you are, the more you can charge. As an entrepreneur, the same theory applies. However it's not **you** that needs to be remarkable. It's the story of the organization.\n\n### Start with people who value the thing you do best instead of trying to be someone else.\n\nAs an entrepreneur myself, I totally understand you. We aspire to live, learn, create and inspire others. That's okay, but the tip is to simply look at what people value about you now to get started. You'll almost certainly get another chance.\n\n### Launching is overrated. What matters is that the first few people trust you and the value you can provide.\n\nAnnnnnndddddddddd LAUNCH! …………. *frog croak*…………… What's worse than someone hating what you have to sell? No one noticing that it's up for sale. The bigger the launch, the more you're going to be disappointed when not many people notice. But for those who do, **honor them**. Treat them like the only customers in the world (oh wait, they are!). If you build trust, they'll respect you and tell their friends.\n\n### In the early stages, be super clear what in you're doing and where the weak parts are so that people can help to scrutinize how to improve. Do this too late and you will be defending the weak points.\n\nDefending the weak points of your business - oh it's one of the hardest moments when being asked to be an advisor to a struggling company. Particularly when you were brought in after all the hard questions were ignored and covered up. The worst part of defending is that it's contagious - once it's part of the culture, everyone does it. Personally, if I'm asked to be an advisor of a startup, I'll only accept if they're willing for me to ask all the hard questions first and then i'll make up my mind. I'm not looking for the right answers, just whether they are covering up their mistakes.\n\n### Connect with the world. Work on things that are difficult, not distractions. Focus time on sharing your story if it matches our worldview and then work on the mechanics of delivering.\n\nThis sentence has an order. Feel free to test it, but it's there for a reason.\n\n### When an industry declines, there are pockets of passionate micro communities who are connected and ready to be buy. Don't get caught up in the macro.\n\nApple Retail is the best in the world at selling their iPhone. The iPhone destroyed the monopoly that Nokia had on the mobile phone industry. Want to be the only business selling 10-year old Nokia 'brick' phones? You have the opportunity to be the best in the world too.\n\n### Position your product against another object, schema or understanding in the customer's head. Reposition against the market leader and encourage diversion of spending.\n\nYou can position nearly any service against another. It doesn't have to be 100% correct but you need to connect with the same worldview that your customer has.\n\n* LinkedIn is Facebook for professionals. *Advertise with us because you sell to professionals not teenagers.*\n* Pinterest is Twitter with only pictures. *Contribute your products because pictures tell a story that words can't.*\n\n### We are scared of asking questions because we are scared of being rejected.\n\nAsk enough questions so that you get rejected at least 5 times each day. Why would you want to get rejected? Just like taking [cold showers,](https://beingremarkable.me/blog/3/1/2013/the-art-of-the-5-minute-cold-shower) the anxiety of being rejected (or cold) is much worse than it actually happening. Start small by calling up for your telephone/bank/electricity provider and ask for a better deal. I really liked the concept behind Charlie Hoen's [Negotiate it](http://charliehoehn.com/2012/10/22/negotiate-it-my-first-iphone-app-plus-32-ideas-ive-abandoned/) app, give it a try if you like the video.\n\n### What do you say to someone in 20 seconds to make them want to hear more?\n\nI admire Steve Jobs for getting this right. He could put together a 20-second story that sparks more interest than my 1-minute ramble (and this is something I'm working on!). For me, I feel that *positioning* your 20 seconds will give you more clarity than adding another 40 seconds of clarification or justification for why you started talking. [Start with why.](http://beingremarkable.me/inspiration) Use 20 seconds to position your intentions and what's in it for the other person. If appropriate, ask for their *permission* to share more.\n\n### If you are a freelancer ask this before every gig: \"Will you write a letter of recommendation when we are done?\" When you get to 50, you won't need to ask any more. You eliminate the one thing from keeping you from being hired.\n\nThe trick to asking for a letter of recommendation is doing it at the very start. Once you have asked, you can forget about it till the end and then hold your customer to their word. Something along the lines of: \"If we proceed and both find this is relationship valuable, is it okay if I ask you for a letter of recommendation?\" (These days you could ask for a LinkedIn recommendation too.)\n\n### The Challenge: gain respect, grow your tribe, and never worry about making money again\n\nAnd what a challenge! In [Kevin Kelly's 1000 True Fans](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/03/1000_true_fans.php), we learnt that the magic number of followers for a creative professional to earn a reasonable income from their art is 1000. The focus here shouldn't be 1000, but it should be respect and trust with each and every member. Make a habit of removing members if they are simply not a good fit. Perhaps suggest that they look to other people for inspiration. You're still helping them, and if you're right, they will move away from you to them because it *feels right.* If you grow 1000 over three years (remember we said never worry about making money again?…it won't happen in a few months), then all you need to do is delight, inspire and learn from one person per day. Remember that we're talking about a true fan, someone who would cross the street to shake your hand and if you recommended the coffee one mile away, they would check it out.\n\n### Do the hardest stuff at the beginning, face the fear, and everyday gets easier from there. Don't do the hard stuff a few months in.\n\nAfter a few startups under my belt - lots of failures and a few gems, this makes so much sense to me. There are things that are hard: business partner relationships that you *know* will be strained, markets that may not be ready, investors who have a different outlook to the entrepreneur, the list goes on. Use[Seth's Ship It Journal](http://beingremarkable.me/inspiration) and identify what is hard and what is easy. Schedule the things that are hard in the first 30 days or shut the business down. If you don't have *that* conversation, *that* investor meeting, *that* customer feedback, you don't have a viable business.\n\n### We feel alive when we dance in the edge of failure.\n\nIt doesn't have to be a lottery to be the edge. The edge of failure is the risk that it might just fail. Risk is likelihood multiplied by consequence. Therefore you will discover that you feel more alive after surviving a 50% chance of your heart failure, rather than a 1% chance of losing your house. Both are significant but the consequence of losing your life trumps everything else. Pick your edges, understand the likelihood and consequence of what might just happen. Seth said that he has never signed a personal guarantee because he doesn't want to play a game where his family are at stake. Facing the prospect of failure is much less scary once you eliminate any consequences that you can't live with.\n\n### When going into business with partners, everyone earns equity over time.\n\nThe example given was that if you have a sales partner, agree that they will earn 1% of the business for each of the 50 critical sales that they bring in within the first 90 days. If the other partner is in technology, perhaps you could peg their ownership against certain milestones of product development (and redevelopment). The idea is that no one, including the founders gets a free ride. If you’re having arguments and someone is making excuses after 90 days, there should be an option to buy them out if they leave at an agreed price to reset the equity that they earned. You don't want an equity holder on board who isn't aligned in the long term strategy of the founders and investors.\n\n### People aren't motivated by money, just the story they tell themselves about money.\n\nEven though the story can sometimes be about what someone imagines they will have, it's more likely to be about **who they think they will be** once they have money. This often doesn't materialize. If you want to inspire people and use money as an incentive, work with them to create their own [dreamline](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/lifestyle-costing/).\n\n### Raise more money than you need, treat it like the last money you'll ever get.\n\nRaising money requires doing the *dog and pony show* for investors who may be interested in the growth of your business. This takes time, energy and emotional labour. You don't want to do it more than you need to so raise more than you need, calculate your cash burn rate and then discover how many days you have to stay in business.\n\n### Track one metric: how many days can I stay in business?\n\nThere are so many metrics that you can track when you have a startup. You'll soon work out that cash flow is the most important thing to watch and to cut it even coarser, it's how many days before you're bankrupt. When the number is too low, you need to do some freelance work or a few small quick-revenue projects to raise more money. In your startup planning, it's worth you knowing what this will be in advance.\n\nIn my first business Apathco Group, we had a contract that I won with the state government to provide small businesses with energy audits for $150 (even though we received $600). We were never going to grow with these projects but they were easy to find, quick to complete and we would have the money to reinvest into our bigger plans.\n\n### When shipping a project, thrash at the beginning. Then take people off the project as it gets closer to ship date.\n\nTake a deep breath if you have ever missed a deadline to ship a project. Yes, that's me too. There have been times when it's me trying to make things perfect, but that doesn't happen anymore. Every time it happens now it's because there were too many decision makers who haven't finished making decisions at the end of the project. This is about environment and expectations. Shape the environment in your favour. Make some rules:\n\n1. When it has been signed off, you will not make any changes or suggestions until it ships.\n2. When the CEO is making a critical pivot decision, everything stops until she has made it.\n\n### The reason why we answer a 10 word question with 100 words is because the other 90 words are there to distract the other person so we don't have to say the 10 words that are true. We don't want to say those 10 words because we are scared of the other person saying 'you should be ashamed of yourself'.\n\n\n## BONUS: YOUR GUIDE TO THE PODCAST\n\n[Get the podcast in iTunes here.](https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/seth-godins-startup-school/id566985370)\n\nEpisode 1 - Freelancer or Entrepreneur?\n\nWelcome to the first episode of Seth Godin’s Startup School.

He also talks about how not to get sued, giving people a souvenir to remember you by, and the rules on naming your company.\n\n[Podcast production by Earwolf Media](http://www.earwolf.com/)\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>If it hasn't been obvious in my previous posts, Seth Godin is one of my absolute mentors. Although we have never met, his books, audiobooks and blog have been a compass for me over many years.</p>\n\n<p>This podcast, although unedited and unpolished, is an extraordinary insight into Seth's thoughts about startups. Seth's welcome message sums up the purpose of the three-day workshop, with featured content within the five-hour podcast.</p>\n\n<p>Seth's welcome message:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>In the summer of 2012, I had an amazing opportunity to spend three days with a group of extremely motivated entrepreneurs. People right at the beginning of building their project, launching their organization. During those three days, I took them on a guided tour of some of the questions they were going to have to wrestle with, some of the difficult places they were going to strand up and say \"this is me, this is what I'm making\".</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"whathasinspiredmeandmayinspireyoutoo\">WHAT HAS INSPIRED ME (AND MAY INSPIRE YOU TOO)</h2>\n\n<p><em>In this section of the post I'm going to highlight a few insights that have inspired me along with a short riff of my own thoughts. Some of these insights may inspire me to write another blog post specifically on that topic. In this case, I'll edit this post that you're reading and link you to the new blog post. Enjoy.</em></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"decidewhetheryoullbeafreelanceroranentrepreneurhttpbeingremarkablemefreelancerorentrepreneursethgodincaresandsoshouldyou\"><a href=\"http://beingremarkable.me/freelancer-or-entrepreneur-seth-godin-cares-and-so-should-you\">Decide whether you'll be a freelancer or an entrepreneur.</a></h3>\n\n<p>The distinction is critical because the emotional cost is high if you think you're one type and act like the other. In its simplest form, a freelancer rents themselves out to someone else to perform valuable emotional labour, whereas an entrepreneur organizes resources (people, connections, capital, time) to build something bigger than themselves.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"marketingistellingastoryaboutthevalueyoucreateforpeoplehttpbeingremarkablememarketingandtellingstoriessethgodinsstartupschool\"><a href=\"http://beingremarkable.me/marketing-and-telling-stories-seth-godins-startup-school\">Marketing is telling a story about the value you create for people.</a></h3>\n\n<p>There is an art and science to marketing. There are courses, books and consultants who teach the science (4-P's, market segmentation….yada…yada…yada). However no matter the execution, if the story doesn't resonate with the tribe you're connecting with there will be no transfer of emotion. They will feel nothing, they won't respond, you'll be ignored. Perhaps this happens when we try market to the masses instead of selecting our tribe. It's easy to ignore someone you walk by in the middle of Sydney, but much harder if it's in Antarctica.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ifyoureinb2bsalesyourprospectonlyhasonedecisiontomakewouldthispurchasedeliveragoodstorytopleasemybossorwilligetfired\">If you're in B2B sales, your prospect only has one decision to make: \"Would this purchase deliver a good story to please my boss? or will I get fired?\"</h3>\n\n<p>I've been on both ends of the conversation: the buyer and the seller. This was something that I never realised and is an incredible insight into where you should focus your time. As someone with a story to tell to another business, you can get that message to CEOs, VPs and middle managers through different channels. You can't ring up the CEO and pitch an idea like you could do with a middle manager. However you can equally build trust in the organization with an investment of time to work out the networking events where these CEOs and VPs meet up. Buy a few minutes of stage time to simply tell your story and don't even think of selling anything on that night.</p>\n\n<p>Now you've got the ability to say to the manager <em>\"Why don't you have a chat to the VP or CEO, they've heard me tell this story before.\"</em> If you're bad at story telling, you didn't build trust with the audience or they don't have the problem that you can solve, you're not going to get any further. However you'll be able to control the process if you're respecting the hierarchy and putting the story before your pitch.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"thejobisnttofindmorecustomersforyourproductsbuttofindmoreproductsforyourcustomers\">The job isn't to find more customers for your products but to find more products for your customers.</h3>\n\n<p>This is at the heart of tribe leadership thinking. If you're putting your contribution to the tribe before your interest in making money from its members, those who you serve will trust you. Alternatively, if you're trying to find more members to fit existing products, you will make compromises on who you will sell to and reduce the value and sentiment within the tribe.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say that your tribe is people with tribal tattoos and you have a photo gallery website for all members to post their tattoos for others to comment on. To make money, you have products where you collect affiliate commissions. To make more money the calculation is: more members = more unique page views = more clicks on affiliate links = more money in the bank. Here's the twist: If you simply accept anyone, whether they have a tribal tattoo or not, you're going to be attracting the <em>wrong</em> sort of people that tribal tattoo people want to hang out with. Bad move. You're better off charging the members a $10 monthly subscription, stack the value offered, and explicitly keep people out unless they are worthy of being a member. Customers before products.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whatsthehardpartofyourbusinessifyoudonthaveahardpartyoudonthaveabusinessspendallofyourtimeonthis\">What's the hard part of your business? If you don't have a hard part, you don't have a business. Spend all of your time on this.</h3>\n\n<p>There are so many easy parts of your business. If you're about to do something, it will fall into these three categories: planning, organizing or contributing. From my personal experience, as well as through advising other entrepreneurs, the first two parts are easy and that's where many spend their time. <strong>Wrong move.</strong> Way too often will an entrepreneur spend their time planning what to do and organizing things. These are activities that should be a) minimized and then b) outsourced. This is why you hire a CEO, CFO and COO right? Contribute to your business by spending time on asking and answering the hard questions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"theproblemisntthatsomeoneiscopyingitsthatnotenoughpeoplearecopyingthishelpssharethemessageacrossthetribesifyouhaveitrightandfocusonaremarkableproductexperienceyouwillwin\">The problem isn't that someone is copying, it's that not enough people are copying. This helps share the message across the tribes. If you have it right and focus on a remarkable product experience, you will win.</h3>\n\n<p>We humans are indeed funny. Too often we act like we're one of the many inventors of the light bulb instead of like Thomas Edison who commercialised the electricity grid. From my experience with <a href=\"http://www.apathco.com.au/\">Apathco Group,</a> our biggest problem wasn't that we would lose a customer to a competitor, it was that we would lose a customer to <em>inaction</em>. We found that more competition in the marketplace actually helped us stand out as experts and could tell a more compelling story to our niche.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whathaveyoubuiltintoyourassumptionsthatyoucouldskiptohelpscalesuccessfullywhilestillbeingscarceandremarkable\">What have you built into your assumptions that you could skip to help scale successfully while still being scarce and remarkable?</h3>\n\n<p>As was the focus in <a href=\"http://beingremarkable.me/inspiration\">Seth's Purple Cow,</a> <strong>scarcity creates value.</strong> As a freelancer, what is the most scarce resource that you have? Your time. If your time is scarce, that means you are scarce. But being scarce isn't good enough. What's the difference between earning $12 per hour and $1200 per hour? How remarkable you are to me.</p>\n\n<p>When you're remarkable, people talk about you. They tell your story and it spreads amongst the tribe. When you're remarkable, more people want you. This creates demand but your supply is constant at 10 hours per day (or week). The more remarkable you are, the more you can charge. As an entrepreneur, the same theory applies. However it's not <strong>you</strong> that needs to be remarkable. It's the story of the organization.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"startwithpeoplewhovaluethethingyoudobestinsteadoftryingtobesomeoneelse\">Start with people who value the thing you do best instead of trying to be someone else.</h3>\n\n<p>As an entrepreneur myself, I totally understand you. We aspire to live, learn, create and inspire others. That's okay, but the tip is to simply look at what people value about you now to get started. You'll almost certainly get another chance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"launchingisoverratedwhatmattersisthatthefirstfewpeopletrustyouandthevalueyoucanprovide\">Launching is overrated. What matters is that the first few people trust you and the value you can provide.</h3>\n\n<p>Annnnnndddddddddd LAUNCH! …………. <em>frog croak</em>…………… What's worse than someone hating what you have to sell? No one noticing that it's up for sale. The bigger the launch, the more you're going to be disappointed when not many people notice. But for those who do, <strong>honor them</strong>. Treat them like the only customers in the world (oh wait, they are!). If you build trust, they'll respect you and tell their friends.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"intheearlystagesbesuperclearwhatinyouredoingandwheretheweakpartsaresothatpeoplecanhelptoscrutinizehowtoimprovedothistoolateandyouwillbedefendingtheweakpoints\">In the early stages, be super clear what in you're doing and where the weak parts are so that people can help to scrutinize how to improve. Do this too late and you will be defending the weak points.</h3>\n\n<p>Defending the weak points of your business - oh it's one of the hardest moments when being asked to be an advisor to a struggling company. Particularly when you were brought in after all the hard questions were ignored and covered up. The worst part of defending is that it's contagious - once it's part of the culture, everyone does it. Personally, if I'm asked to be an advisor of a startup, I'll only accept if they're willing for me to ask all the hard questions first and then i'll make up my mind. I'm not looking for the right answers, just whether they are covering up their mistakes.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"connectwiththeworldworkonthingsthataredifficultnotdistractionsfocustimeonsharingyourstoryifitmatchesourworldviewandthenworkonthemechanicsofdelivering\">Connect with the world. Work on things that are difficult, not distractions. Focus time on sharing your story if it matches our worldview and then work on the mechanics of delivering.</h3>\n\n<p>This sentence has an order. Feel free to test it, but it's there for a reason.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whenanindustrydeclinestherearepocketsofpassionatemicrocommunitieswhoareconnectedandreadytobebuydontgetcaughtupinthemacro\">When an industry declines, there are pockets of passionate micro communities who are connected and ready to be buy. Don't get caught up in the macro.</h3>\n\n<p>Apple Retail is the best in the world at selling their iPhone. The iPhone destroyed the monopoly that Nokia had on the mobile phone industry. Want to be the only business selling 10-year old Nokia 'brick' phones? You have the opportunity to be the best in the world too.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"positionyourproductagainstanotherobjectschemaorunderstandinginthecustomersheadrepositionagainstthemarketleaderandencouragediversionofspending\">Position your product against another object, schema or understanding in the customer's head. Reposition against the market leader and encourage diversion of spending.</h3>\n\n<p>You can position nearly any service against another. It doesn't have to be 100% correct but you need to connect with the same worldview that your customer has.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>LinkedIn is Facebook for professionals. <em>Advertise with us because you sell to professionals not teenagers.</em></li>\n<li>Pinterest is Twitter with only pictures. <em>Contribute your products because pictures tell a story that words can't.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"wearescaredofaskingquestionsbecausewearescaredofbeingrejected\">We are scared of asking questions because we are scared of being rejected.</h3>\n\n<p>Ask enough questions so that you get rejected at least 5 times each day. Why would you want to get rejected? Just like taking <a href=\"https://beingremarkable.me/blog/3/1/2013/the-art-of-the-5-minute-cold-shower\">cold showers,</a> the anxiety of being rejected (or cold) is much worse than it actually happening. Start small by calling up for your telephone/bank/electricity provider and ask for a better deal. I really liked the concept behind Charlie Hoen's <a href=\"http://charliehoehn.com/2012/10/22/negotiate-it-my-first-iphone-app-plus-32-ideas-ive-abandoned/\">Negotiate it</a> app, give it a try if you like the video.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whatdoyousaytosomeonein20secondstomakethemwanttohearmore\">What do you say to someone in 20 seconds to make them want to hear more?</h3>\n\n<p>I admire Steve Jobs for getting this right. He could put together a 20-second story that sparks more interest than my 1-minute ramble (and this is something I'm working on!). For me, I feel that <em>positioning</em> your 20 seconds will give you more clarity than adding another 40 seconds of clarification or justification for why you started talking. <a href=\"http://beingremarkable.me/inspiration\">Start with why.</a> Use 20 seconds to position your intentions and what's in it for the other person. If appropriate, ask for their <em>permission</em> to share more.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ifyouareafreelanceraskthisbeforeeverygigwillyouwritealetterofrecommendationwhenwearedonewhenyougetto50youwontneedtoaskanymoreyoueliminatetheonethingfromkeepingyoufrombeinghired\">If you are a freelancer ask this before every gig: \"Will you write a letter of recommendation when we are done?\" When you get to 50, you won't need to ask any more. You eliminate the one thing from keeping you from being hired.</h3>\n\n<p>The trick to asking for a letter of recommendation is doing it at the very start. Once you have asked, you can forget about it till the end and then hold your customer to their word. Something along the lines of: \"If we proceed and both find this is relationship valuable, is it okay if I ask you for a letter of recommendation?\" (These days you could ask for a LinkedIn recommendation too.)</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"thechallengegainrespectgrowyourtribeandneverworryaboutmakingmoneyagain\">The Challenge: gain respect, grow your tribe, and never worry about making money again</h3>\n\n<p>And what a challenge! In <a href=\"http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/03/1000_true_fans.php\">Kevin Kelly's 1000 True Fans</a>, we learnt that the magic number of followers for a creative professional to earn a reasonable income from their art is 1000. The focus here shouldn't be 1000, but it should be respect and trust with each and every member. Make a habit of removing members if they are simply not a good fit. Perhaps suggest that they look to other people for inspiration. You're still helping them, and if you're right, they will move away from you to them because it <em>feels right.</em> If you grow 1000 over three years (remember we said never worry about making money again?…it won't happen in a few months), then all you need to do is delight, inspire and learn from one person per day. Remember that we're talking about a true fan, someone who would cross the street to shake your hand and if you recommended the coffee one mile away, they would check it out.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dothehardeststuffatthebeginningfacethefearandeverydaygetseasierfromtheredontdothehardstuffafewmonthsin\">Do the hardest stuff at the beginning, face the fear, and everyday gets easier from there. Don't do the hard stuff a few months in.</h3>\n\n<p>After a few startups under my belt - lots of failures and a few gems, this makes so much sense to me. There are things that are hard: business partner relationships that you <em>know</em> will be strained, markets that may not be ready, investors who have a different outlook to the entrepreneur, the list goes on. Use<a href=\"http://beingremarkable.me/inspiration\">Seth's Ship It Journal</a> and identify what is hard and what is easy. Schedule the things that are hard in the first 30 days or shut the business down. If you don't have <em>that</em> conversation, <em>that</em> investor meeting, <em>that</em> customer feedback, you don't have a viable business.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wefeelalivewhenwedanceintheedgeoffailure\">We feel alive when we dance in the edge of failure.</h3>\n\n<p>It doesn't have to be a lottery to be the edge. The edge of failure is the risk that it might just fail. Risk is likelihood multiplied by consequence. Therefore you will discover that you feel more alive after surviving a 50% chance of your heart failure, rather than a 1% chance of losing your house. Both are significant but the consequence of losing your life trumps everything else. Pick your edges, understand the likelihood and consequence of what might just happen. Seth said that he has never signed a personal guarantee because he doesn't want to play a game where his family are at stake. Facing the prospect of failure is much less scary once you eliminate any consequences that you can't live with.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whengoingintobusinesswithpartnerseveryoneearnsequityovertime\">When going into business with partners, everyone earns equity over time.</h3>\n\n<p>The example given was that if you have a sales partner, agree that they will earn 1% of the business for each of the 50 critical sales that they bring in within the first 90 days. If the other partner is in technology, perhaps you could peg their ownership against certain milestones of product development (and redevelopment). The idea is that no one, including the founders gets a free ride. If you’re having arguments and someone is making excuses after 90 days, there should be an option to buy them out if they leave at an agreed price to reset the equity that they earned. You don't want an equity holder on board who isn't aligned in the long term strategy of the founders and investors.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"peoplearentmotivatedbymoneyjustthestorytheytellthemselvesaboutmoney\">People aren't motivated by money, just the story they tell themselves about money.</h3>\n\n<p>Even though the story can sometimes be about what someone imagines they will have, it's more likely to be about <strong>who they think they will be</strong> once they have money. This often doesn't materialize. If you want to inspire people and use money as an incentive, work with them to create their own <a href=\"http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/lifestyle-costing/\">dreamline</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"raisemoremoneythanyouneedtreatitlikethelastmoneyyoulleverget\">Raise more money than you need, treat it like the last money you'll ever get.</h3>\n\n<p>Raising money requires doing the <em>dog and pony show</em> for investors who may be interested in the growth of your business. This takes time, energy and emotional labour. You don't want to do it more than you need to so raise more than you need, calculate your cash burn rate and then discover how many days you have to stay in business.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"trackonemetrichowmanydayscanistayinbusiness\">Track one metric: how many days can I stay in business?</h3>\n\n<p>There are so many metrics that you can track when you have a startup. You'll soon work out that cash flow is the most important thing to watch and to cut it even coarser, it's how many days before you're bankrupt. When the number is too low, you need to do some freelance work or a few small quick-revenue projects to raise more money. In your startup planning, it's worth you knowing what this will be in advance.</p>\n\n<p>In my first business Apathco Group, we had a contract that I won with the state government to provide small businesses with energy audits for $150 (even though we received $600). We were never going to grow with these projects but they were easy to find, quick to complete and we would have the money to reinvest into our bigger plans.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whenshippingaprojectthrashatthebeginningthentakepeopleofftheprojectasitgetsclosertoshipdate\">When shipping a project, thrash at the beginning. Then take people off the project as it gets closer to ship date.</h3>\n\n<p>Take a deep breath if you have ever missed a deadline to ship a project. Yes, that's me too. There have been times when it's me trying to make things perfect, but that doesn't happen anymore. Every time it happens now it's because there were too many decision makers who haven't finished making decisions at the end of the project. This is about environment and expectations. Shape the environment in your favour. Make some rules:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>When it has been signed off, you will not make any changes or suggestions until it ships.  </li>\n<li>When the CEO is making a critical pivot decision, everything stops until she has made it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"thereasonwhyweanswera10wordquestionwith100wordsisbecausetheother90wordsaretheretodistracttheotherpersonsowedonthavetosaythe10wordsthataretruewedontwanttosaythose10wordsbecausewearescaredoftheotherpersonsayingyoushouldbeashamedofyourself\">The reason why we answer a 10 word question with 100 words is because the other 90 words are there to distract the other person so we don't have to say the 10 words that are true. We don't want to say those 10 words because we are scared of the other person saying 'you should be ashamed of yourself'.</h3>\n\n<h2 id=\"bonusyourguidetothepodcast\">BONUS: YOUR GUIDE TO THE PODCAST</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/seth-godins-startup-school/id566985370\">Get the podcast in iTunes here.</a></p>\n\n<p>Episode 1 - Freelancer or Entrepreneur?</p>\n\n<p>Welcome to the first episode of Seth Godin’s Startup School.

That's not the point. **Join me, while we break these assumptions.**\n\n### Where is the glass when you start your day?\n\nEvery one of us will be spend time with someone who is suffering from depression. Perhaps you don't realise it, or it could be you who is suffering, or even worse - it's you and you don't realise it. The illness of the mind affects us all.\n\nThe easiest way I can describe to people what depression is all about is to go back our glass. Yes, depressed people see the glass as half empty, or more often, empty. This isn't profound nor a useful framework to help us understand depression. Instead, I refer to where the glass is when you start your day.\n\nDo you recall those days where things just keep getting worse? Or perhaps those days when you can't help but absolutely **win** everything possible to win (including traffic lights, spot bargains and parking spots). If I was a betting guy, I'd bet that bad things happened on your good days and good things happen on your bad days - you just don't *see* them.\n\nWhen your glass is exactly half-way* (doesn't matter right now which was you see it),* it's either going to get better or worse. As things get better, you're less likely to see the bad things that happen. Yep, you guessed it - as things get worse...they feel like they're **much**  worse as you notice everything about the world you hate.\n\nBack to depression. People who are depressed start their day with a glass almost empty.

The illness of the mind affects us all.</p>\n\n<p>The easiest way I can describe to people what depression is all about is to go back our glass. Yes, depressed people see the glass as half empty, or more often, empty. This isn't profound nor a useful framework to help us understand depression.

Or perhaps those days when you can't help but absolutely <strong>win</strong> everything possible to win (including traffic lights, spot bargains and parking spots).

Fall for one of these and you’re very likely to fail. Failure doesn't mean your entrepreneurship journey is over, but this failure won't teach you anything you can't learn in the next 5 minutes.

However consider the problem here. You are only considering those who actually were successful (otherwise why would you look up to them for guidance?)\n\nI am certain that they **also** had a deep connection with the other people who had the same problem they had before they *scratched their itch.* The ones who failed and never make it onto your radar are those who assumed everyone had *their* problem.\n\n\"The arrogance to assume everyone has YOUR problem will make you fail\n\nWhy does this happen? Startups are fun, you could make a lot of money, you could be a rockstar. **You are biased.** Although it generally can be hugely beneficial, if you are the target customer your arrogance may make you fail.\n\nAdmittedly, myself among every entrepreneur I know has been in this situation at least once or twice before. We dive so deep into solving the problem with (what seems as) the perfect market conditions, we are convinced that our product has become the ‘market standard’ before anyone hears about it (except for our friends, family and dog).\n\nIf the problem is real, then your target customers are solving it in one way or another today.\n\nIn most occurrences other technology and products exist that will probably solve 80-90% of the problem they are facing. Your job is to understand if they are more receptive to their current solution being better/cheaper/easier to use etc. Don't build better if they want cheaper. Especially don't build better because you want better. (If this really is going to be a business.)\n\n**The lesson:** Never invest in solving a problem that people aren't trying to solve today. Convincing people they have a problem is **way** harder than addressing one that frustrates them right now.\n\n***\n\n## When you're holding a hammer, everything looks like a nail\n\nAs you grow your business you will undoubtedly discover that customers have more problems than the one you set out to solve. What typically happens is the ‘We can do that too' pitch.\n\nIt seems like easy money right? Looking at a customer’s new problem as an extension of their first problem is likely going to result in shortcuts on finding the best solution.\n\nFor example, let’s say that you have helped a client with their social media strategy and your team consists of a web developer, a designer and you. When you hear the client say they want a CRM that would link into their social media accounts the natural reaction is: ‘We can do that!’ They love you, accept your offer and you get to work with your team on building a CRM for your client.\n\nThe better option would be to see what products out there do 80-90% of their requirements and help them navigate through the process, looking for what problems come up. Just because you have a team who knows some things about the web doesn’t mean throwing them at every problem is going to be your best foot forward.\n\nConsulting on implementing your biggest and boldest competitor's product will teach you a lot about how to differentiate yourself in the market.\n\n**The lesson:** Just because you know **how** to solve a problem doesn't mean you should. Look for the best possible alternatives and work with your customers to figure out the issues with what is available today.

We all do. However just because you know them and they are smarter than you, it doesn’t mean they are the best fit for your team.\n\nThe right people for your team depends on what you're trying to build. How smart they are is a tiny part of what really matters. Two great people that work together is much more valuable than two amazing people who work against each other.\n\nHiring someone just because you know them is **always** a terrible strategy. Even if they end up working out in your team, you failed as an entrepreneur. Too often have I seen technology companies base their product around the limited knowledge of the first 'technical' cofounder (because you couldn't pay cash). Too often have I seen service companies waste a quarter-million dollars on salespeople who they hired because they were too scared to sell their own product.\n\n**The lesson:** don't hire someone who impresses you about something you don't understand and don't want to admit.\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><img src=\"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/beingremarkable/2016/Sep/blogpost-1474867854691.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\nWhen was the last time you heard an admirable entrepreneur giving the advice of ‘Scratch your own itch’?</p>\n\n<p>At your first glimpse, with the anecdotal help of successful <a href=\"http://beingremarkable.me/blog/a-new-face-product-entrepreneurship\">product entrepreneurs</a> who made it big by simply looking for ‘a better way’, the advice sounds like a great idea.

If you're just a little like me, when you read this question there is a cloud of insecurity that hovers over your head waiting to point out that *'you're not a real entrepreneur'.*\n\nContrarily to the story we tell ourselves, this doubt of worthiness doesn't go away with success. The lingering insecurity after you climbed those mountains that were twice as high as you first imagined is as uncomfortable as waking up in a tuxedo.\n\nDon't take my word for it, ask any successful entrepreneur and they'll share the same doubts and insecurities about their place in the world as you do. They just have a different tint (or instagram filter) that they see though.\n\nBack to the question, let me make it easier for you. After years of starting, poking, thrashing, growing, failing and [many more adjectives] in the startup world, I've experienced three distinct types of Entrepreneurs:\n\n* The Hustler - (Sales Entrepreneurs)\n* The Genius - (Technical Entrepreneurs)\n* The Tribe Leader - (Product Entrepreneurs)\n\n### The Hustler\n\nYes, *The Hustler* is a film (that I haven't seen) and[IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054997/) thinks it's about an 8.1 / 10. But I'm talking about the infamous protagonist from another movie - [Wall Street](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291/) (which IMDb rates as 7.1 / 10...oh well).\n\nGordon Gekko is the authentic Sales Entrepreneur. My guess is that you know entrepreneurs who seem to aspire to be like *old mate GG* in the way they talk, dress, act and the stories they tell themselves about the world we live in. \n\nThe misconception is that Sales Entrepreneurs care only about money. This isn't true. The only thing they care about is winning the game.\n\nYou know when you meet the Hustler when they don't really care about the product or service that they are selling. You'll hear them say things like:\n\n*\"We're going to disrupt this industry\"*\n\n*\"We only need 1% of this $12b market\"*\n\n*The Hustler* sees the natural breeding rate of mice in the world and has the insight that if they can buy a cheap enough mouse trap to sell to the most number of people, they'll win in the mouse trap business.\n\n### The Genius\n\n[Steve Wazniak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak) is the archetypical \"Genius\". These *Technical entrepreneurs* have very different aspirations to the *Hustlers*. Their sense of professional worth usually doesn't come from connecting with customer aspirations but rather from reaching the technical elite in their industry.\n\nThey build products in the way that *they* would want to use them. This sometimes turns out to be what the market wants, although often it's not. Their comparison of value comes from what their peers are working on, whether it's computer science, engineering, architecture, music and even literature, the Genius cares about mastery of their area of expertise.\n\nThe Genius sees the world though their technical lens and solves every problem within their domain of knowledge. Where their worldview resonates with a market, they can be very successful.\n\nYou know you're talking to a Technical Entrepreneur when you'll hear them say:\n\n*\"How this looks on the inside matters to me just as much as the outside does to the world\"*\n\nA Genius recognises that the world doesn't need a better mouse trap, but you could engineer a better way of stopping the mice from breeding and never need a mouse trap again.\n\n### The Tribe Leader\n\nTribe Leaders only care about a few people at any one time. They obsess over these people. They bring them together, connect them, explore their problems and analyse what these problems mean by standing in the shoes of their followers.\n\n**Product Entrepreneurship** is the path taken by entrepreneurs who see themselves as Tribe Leaders. It's a process of starting with a niche market and focusing on what causes them pain, joy and utility as a source of generating business opportunities.\n\nTribe Leaders will spend most of their time with their followers, refining and validating their assumptions on how the tribe sees the world. Their goal is to strip away all of the layers that come between their current worldview and the shared worldview of their tribe.

Right now, I'd like to get back to the art of consistent blogging and perhaps sporadic video and audio...who knows.\n\n**Question:** When you first read the term 'Product Entrepreneurship', what were your initial thoughts?\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><em><a href=\"https://medium.com/product-entrepreneurship\">As seen on medium.</a></em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"whattypeofentrepreneurareyou\">What type of entrepreneur are you?</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps this question raises more questions that it ever will answer. If you're just a little like me, when you read this question there is a cloud of insecurity that hovers over your head waiting to point out that <em>'you're not a real entrepreneur'.</em></p>\n\n<p>Contrarily to the story we tell ourselves, this doubt of worthiness doesn't go away with success. The lingering insecurity after you climbed those mountains that were twice as high as you first imagined is as uncomfortable as waking up in a tuxedo.</p>\n\n<p>Don't take my word for it, ask any successful entrepreneur and they'll share the same doubts and insecurities about their place in the world as you do. They just have a different tint (or instagram filter) that they see though.</p>\n\n<p>Back to the question, let me make it easier for you. After years of starting, poking, thrashing, growing, failing and [many more adjectives] in the startup world, I've experienced three distinct types of Entrepreneurs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Hustler - (Sales Entrepreneurs)</li>\n<li>The Genius - (Technical Entrepreneurs)</li>\n<li>The Tribe Leader - (Product Entrepreneurs)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"thehustler\">The Hustler</h3>\n\n<p>Yes, <em>The Hustler</em> is a film (that I haven't seen) and<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054997/\">IMDb</a> thinks it's about an 8.1 / 10. But I'm talking about the infamous protagonist from another movie - <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291/\">Wall Street</a> (which IMDb rates as 7.1 / 10...oh well).</p>\n\n<p>Gordon Gekko is the authentic Sales Entrepreneur. My guess is that you know entrepreneurs who seem to aspire to be like <em>old mate GG</em> in the way they talk, dress, act and the stories they tell themselves about the world we live in. </p>\n\n<p>The misconception is that Sales Entrepreneurs care only about money. This isn't true. The only thing they care about is winning the game.</p>\n\n<p>You know when you meet the Hustler when they don't really care about the product or service that they are selling. You'll hear them say things like:</p>\n\n<p><em>\"We're going to disrupt this industry\"</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\"We only need 1% of this $12b market\"</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Hustler</em> sees the natural breeding rate of mice in the world and has the insight that if they can buy a cheap enough mouse trap to sell to the most number of people, they'll win in the mouse trap business.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"thegenius\">The Genius</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak\">Steve Wazniak</a> is the archetypical \"Genius\". These <em>Technical entrepreneurs</em> have very different aspirations to the <em>Hustlers</em>. Their sense of professional worth usually doesn't come from connecting with customer aspirations but rather from reaching the technical elite in their industry.</p>\n\n<p>They build products in the way that <em>they</em> would want to use them. This sometimes turns out to be what the market wants, although often it's not. Their comparison of value comes from what their peers are working on, whether it's computer science, engineering, architecture, music and even literature, the Genius cares about mastery of their area of expertise.</p>\n\n<p>The Genius sees the world though their technical lens and solves every problem within their domain of knowledge. Where their worldview resonates with a market, they can be very successful.</p>\n\n<p>You know you're talking to a Technical Entrepreneur when you'll hear them say:</p>\n\n<p><em>\"How this looks on the inside matters to me just as much as the outside does to the world\"</em></p>\n\n<p>A Genius recognises that the world doesn't need a better mouse trap, but you could engineer a better way of stopping the mice from breeding and never need a mouse trap again.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"thetribeleader\">The Tribe Leader</h3>\n\n<p>Tribe Leaders only care about a few people at any one time. They obsess over these people. They bring them together, connect them, explore their problems and analyse what these problems mean by standing in the shoes of their followers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Product Entrepreneurship</strong> is the path taken by entrepreneurs who see themselves as Tribe Leaders. It's a process of starting with a niche market and focusing on what causes them pain, joy and utility as a source of generating business opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>Tribe Leaders will spend most of their time with their followers, refining and validating their assumptions on how the tribe sees the world. Their goal is to strip away all of the layers that come between their current worldview and the shared worldview of their tribe. They want to <em>feel</em> the pain that their followers feel with the purpose of providing a solution to remove that pain.</p>\n\n<p>Product Entrepreneurs start at a very different place to Sales and Technical Entrepreneurs. They don't have ideas, they don't have products, they don't have markets. They identify an group of people who share a worldview and seek to understand what common problems are painful enough to solve.</p>\n\n<p>You'll hear a Product Entrepreneur say something like:</p>\n\n<p><em>\"Why have you always done it this way?</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\"What would it mean to you if you never had to deal with [insert problem here] again?\"</em></p>\n\n<p>Product Entrepreneurs don't care about the general <em>mouse-trap problem</em>but they will focus on how the mice effect one segment.

My first detailed dive into these insights was [Freelancer or Entrepreneur? Seth Godin cares and so should you](http://beingremarkable.me/freelancer-or-entrepreneur-seth-godin-cares-and-so-should-you), here is my second.\n\nMarketing is an interesting idea. Everyone has a different perspective on the definition and practise of marketing. Some people think that advertising and marketing are essentially the same thing, others see that marketing is simply everything that happens with the customer before selling. Here’s my definition:\n\n*Marketing is making promises, delivering experiences and telling stories.*\n\n***\n\n## Your product should have failed.\n\nYour idea was just another idea. Others have thought of it before and probably dropped it before you started. But you’re here right now because you have a passion to make people feel something they have never felt before. My best guess is that you want to deliver a remarkable experience and tell the world how your product changed the lives of your customers.\n\n## You are a storyteller. You are a marketer.\n\nEvery entrepreneur must be able to market and sell their work. In the beginning, you can not outsource marketing. Sure, you could outsource advertising, or PR but both of these activities rely on the entrepreneur making promises and telling stories that can be captured and distributed to the world. If you leave the promises up to your outsourced development team and stories to the outsourced PR team, both who have no emotional connection with your product, you indeed will fail.\n\nAs the entrepreneur, you decide what identifies the type of customer you want to influence. You decide what you are going to promise and what story you want to resonate with these customers,\n\nLet’s look at some examples.\n\n***\n\n**Amazon.com**\n\nIn 2002, Jeff Bezos decided that Amazon.com would reallocate their advertising budget into something that was (at the time) remarkable - free shipping. It turns out that shipping costs were one of the reasons why people didn’t buy goods online. Removing this from the price equation (initially the limit was min $99, then reduced to $25 and now at $35) was one less barrier towards a new customer trusting Amazon and a repeat customer returning. It’s hard to imagine what it’s like to not trust Amazon as a worthy retailer, but the early 2000’s was a race to become #1.\n\nIn this case, Bezos' focus moved away from interrupting strangers towards delighting new customers and encouraging them to share the remarkability of Amazon. Bezos created a compelling story that people shared: cheaper products and no shipping.\n\n\n**Mailbox**\n\nThe team at Orchestra started working on the Mailbox app in September 2012. They launched in Febuary 2013, served millions of users and sold to Dropbox in March for $100M. What’s the full story? They released a video showing their vision of how Mailbox would change the way people interact with their email. On releasing this video, they hoped to get about 100k views before launching the app but we're lucky enough to have millions of people engaged in their new vision for 'putting email in its place'.\n\nAfter the launch, they sustained buzz around the product by using a waiting list within the application. A new user would sign up and see their place in the queue, but more importantly, how many people were behind them. This is remarkability at it's core. Everyone was talking about Mailbox in their social circles by comparing their place in the activation queue.\n\n\n**Tile**\n\nBack in July [I interviewed Mike and Nick from Tile](http://beingremarkable.me/session9). At that point they were in the middle of their self starter crowdfunding campaign. They were only a couple of hundred thousand dollars in, and already 20x more successful than they expected. By the end of the campaign, they raised $2.6M in crowdfunding presages for their new product. During the interview, I asked the guys what they thought the critical keys to their success were. Apart from answering every question on every blog where people were commenting about the press coverage of Tile, the guys were very focused on what they stood for and what change they were making in the world.\n\nNo Android support, no replaceable batteries, one color.\n\nMike and Nick were not trying to please everyone who had an opinion. They knew that their product would change the lives of their customers and nothing else matters for now. The fact that an Android user slags them off because they don't support his phone, simply didn't both them.\n\n***\n\nWhat did you learn about marketing and telling stories from [Seth Godin’s Startup School](http://beingremarkable.me/25-insights-from-seth-godins-startup-school)?\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><strong>Marketing is telling a story about the value you create for people.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year I wrote a post called <a href=\"http://beingremarkable.me/25-insights-from-seth-godins-startup-school\">25 insights from Seth Godin’s Startup School</a>.

Isn't it?\n\n*Over the past month I have had the pleasure of hearing many product and idea pitches. This blog post is long overdue and I have mixed feelings about which way to write. So I'm I'm doing both in two parts.*\n\n## PT 1: AVOIDING FAILURE IS COSTLY\n\nSince when was it not okay to fail? Ok, I know the answer to this question, but now it's your turn. Can you remember when you decided that failure was associated with the end of the world, or your life as you know it? There is a good chance that there is some silly psychology going on and I honestly don't want to explore it. Here's the truth:\n\n**Whatever you create for the first time, will fail.**\n\nOh you heard a story about someone who had an idea, raised some money, became successful and now they are retired at 25? Nice one. They were lucky - someone had to be. Right?\n\nYou won't hear the stories about the person who showed up and did the emotional labor of asking strangers what they thought of their idea, until they worked out who was their market and what story resonated with the way they saw the world. You don't hear this story because it's boring to everyday dreamers who are sold on big dreams, scams and not a lot of hard work. Real entrepreneurs don't value these stories, they don't comment on them. They simply smile and get back to work on things that matter.\n\nReal entrepreneurs know as a sure certainty that whatever they create - the product, the experience, the pitch, the website, the video, the interaction.....will ultimately not fit everyone who intersects with it. **That's okay with them.** It is okay to fail, just do it quick and spend more time on people who are willing to cross the street to see you.\n\nIf you accept that whatever you create will not work the way you expected it to, for the people you thought would love it the most, you'll now have two realizations: \n\n1. Don't waste your life savings, months of your time and burn every network connection you have to get your first prototype into the market.\n\n2. Work out the quickest way to fail and do it **fast.**\n\n## What is failure anyway?\n\n1. You make assumptions.\n2. They are wrong.\n\n**Not:** you are a failure as a person, as a provider for your family, as an entrepreneur, as a person with great ideas. No, you simply made assumptions that were wrong.\n\nWe all make assumptions about other people that are wrong, but we don't nearly beat ourselves up as much about it (as perhaps we should). Don't be so hard on yourself, you don't know everything...and that's a good thing. \n\n## How to fail fast\n\n1. Work on just enough of an idea that you can pitch the product to (who you think) is a potential buyer. This must be under 1 minute. Try limit your materials unless you really need mockups. Visuals can aide understanding but also just give you a way to hide. **Don't hide.**\n\n2. Ask great questions. Every pitch I have heard recently involved **me**  asking questions (see Pt 2 below). You are doing the validation, **you** ask the questions.\n\n3. Revise your pitch and do it again until you find the right product/customer fit. You may need to change some of the details in how the product works or how you price it. Or you may need to re-pitch the same product to a new potential customer in a new market. You'll only work this out if you ask great questions. \n\n4. Ask for the money. If they like your idea and are willing to pay for it, ask for the whole amount or a deposit of $10, or $20 etc. If someone won't give you the money, they are simply being nice and don't really think it's a good idea. Think this is silly? How does Kickstarter work?\n\nThere are so many ways you can transfer money instantly. You could take someone to your Kickstarter page or your self-starter page hosted on Wordpress. You could ask them to send money through Paypal or many banking apps now allow you to send money on the fly. \n\nWhy won't you ask for money? You're scared. *(Read on)* \n\n## PT 2: ARROGANCE WILL COST YOU MORE\n\nIt happens to all of us, we all do it. We fall in love with our product concept and the idea of who we think we will be when our venture is successful. This type of thinking will encourage you to stop yourself from failing and cost you much more time and money than ever expected. This is arrogance.\n\nArrogance is when you: \n\n* Don't understand who you're pitching to.\n* Don't listen to feedback.\n* Defend your idea instead of clarifying your understanding and improving your pitch.\n* Think that the product is more important than the problem it is solving.\n* Mess with probabilities to make your idea sound good (to you). \n* Have no idea about what assumptions you're making. \n* Pick technology first, a product design second and then a customer problem last. \n* Get scared about pitching an idea because someone will steal it.\n* Hide behind legals, business structures, equity agreements, insurances, setting up technology, writing policies and procedures....all because you don't want to pitch your product and get rejected.\n\nIf you're still reading this and haven't closed the page, you probably have what it takes to get something off the ground. Those people who closed the page may become successful through manipulation of people and finding information gaps in markets, but they'll never know what it's like to delight customers with an exceptional experience and ship a remarkable product.\n\nMy hope is that you will change the world, for some people. You will get rid of bad ideas fast and work on things that matter. Like many entrepreneurs, I have made every mistake bulleted above. As you strip the arrogance away you find someone who is scared of what the world will think of them.\n\nIronically, stripping away your arrogance turns you into a remarkable entrepreneur. Be that person, the world wants you to be.\n\n*Your turn: What are some of your biggest lessons learnt?* \n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>...but that's okay.

We fall in love with our product concept and the idea of who we think we will be when our venture is successful. This type of thinking will encourage you to stop yourself from failing and cost you much more time and money than ever expected. This is arrogance.</p>\n\n<p>Arrogance is when you: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Don't understand who you're pitching to.</li>\n<li>Don't listen to feedback.</li>\n<li>Defend your idea instead of clarifying your understanding and improving your pitch.</li>\n<li>Think that the product is more important than the problem it is solving.</li>\n<li>Mess with probabilities to make your idea sound good (to you). </li>\n<li>Have no idea about what assumptions you're making. </li>\n<li>Pick technology first, a product design second and then a customer problem last. </li>\n<li>Get scared about pitching an idea because someone will steal it.</li>\n<li>Hide behind legals, business structures, equity agreements, insurances, setting up technology, writing policies and procedures....all because you don't want to pitch your product and get rejected.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you're still reading this and haven't closed the page, you probably have what it takes to get something off the ground.

You will get rid of bad ideas fast and work on things that matter. Like many entrepreneurs, I have made every mistake bulleted above. As you strip the arrogance away you find someone who is scared of what the world will think of them.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, stripping away your arrogance turns you into a remarkable entrepreneur.

Yes, these are surprising but are they remarkable?

We have the habit of deciding, the habit of choosing a destination and the habits that take us on the journey. As Seth wrote[ a few days ago](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2013/06/angry-is-a-habit.html): \n\n> Habits are great when they help us get what we want. Bad habits, on the other hand, are bad because the shortcut that satisfies us in the moment gets in the way of our long term goals.\n\n## The Decision\n\nThe decision is not an event.\n\nYou don't decide once. Instead, you decide **every day** that you are going to consistently apply yourself to be the person you want to be. Sure, there is the *first time* that you decide, but it's not going to be the last so there's no need to throw a party.\n\nIf you want to succeed, decide publicly.\n\nTelling your tribe that you're committing to a change is putting your back up against the wall. Eliminate the choice of fight or flight and simply fight until you win or fail. Your tribe will respect you for your honesty, if they don't, get a new one. Don't bother with people who don't support your destination. It's your journey, not theirs.\n\n## The Journey\n\nIf you have committed to making the decision and you know where you're going, choose the path that takes you there.\n\nPerhaps in your story there is great hardship and triumph. Wait, of course there is...it would be a boring story without this. In writing the story about your journey, you'll realize that all of the temptations of shortcuts that you face every day will likely make the story more remarkable when you overcome them or more boring when you give in. Being remarkable means that you will see good times and hard times. You will fail. But that isn't the end of the story.\n\nYour journey is the story about the habits you mastered each and every day when you showed up and decided to be remarkable.\n\n## The Destination\n\nWhere are you going?\n\n'Get fit' isn't a destination, nor is 'be rich'. On the contrary to the management paradigm of SMART goals, being incredibly detailed about the results of your goals isn't that useful to help you decide on suitable destination.\n\nBeing specific with your goals is simply filtering the outcome you want through your expectations of what everyone else thinks of you. **Pick yourself**, and teach others to measure you the way you want to be measured.\n\nWrite yourself a story.\n\nImagine you are telling this story to a group of 2041 students in their final year of collage of perhaps business leaders from around the world. What is the destination that you reached that inspires them to listen to what you have to say? Perhaps this includes tangible metrics however the focus isn't on a number but the story that resonates with these people.\n\nYour destination should enable you to tell this story, authentically and with great pride. \n\n**What is your story?**\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>Every day you could do something that surprises others.

(It <strong>is</strong> a new path after all!)</p>\n\n<p>However conversely, not following the masses and forging a new path that wasn't laid out by someone before us seems like a smart thing to do if your ambitions are to live a non-conventional life.</p>\n\n<p>And this is the lesson.</p>\n\n<p>Starting from the perspective of understanding what you want your life to represent should determine which path you take. I'm not talking about setting goals. I'm not talking about a mission statement. This isn't even a question you need to answer right now, but you need to be aware of the question.</p>\n\n<p><em>What life do I want to create?</em></p>\n\n<p>I'm sure you recognise that if you do everything the same as everyone else and expect a different result, you're kidding yourself. However more often than not it's a case of a could-be entrepreneur who thinks that spending time drawing up lots of business plans is going to yield a different path. Unlikely.</p>\n\n<p>If you want your life to be different, but you're not sure how, it doesn't mean you need to recreate everything yourself. Look for other people who have created a path for you to try. You don't need to innovate on every part of your life, but knowing when to follow and when to forge will be the key to unlocking your potential to focus on the things that matter to you the most.</p>\n\n<p>Next time you see a pack of animals, spend a few minutes to watch them and choose who you think resembles the entrepreneur of the group. What do you notice about them? Are they the one trying to break free? Or maybe they are the one in the pack that comes up to you - the weird human, because you represent change and opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>The story you tell yourself about these animals reflects the story you believe about entrepreneurship.</p>\n\n<p>What story do you tell yourself?</p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-09-26T04:55:04.000Z","created_by":4,"updated_at":"2016-10-17T08:21:18.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2014-07-17T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1,"amp":null},{"id":168,"uuid":"ff924d56-e695-4fd3-89a6-9ebcb2a87190","title":"3 phases of hacking my life","slug":"3-phases-of-hacking-my-life","markdown":"**Synopsis**: we limit ourselves by constraints.

I'm used to having constraints!\"\nPhase 2: Getting into it - \"This is kinda fun! Spin the wheel and that's what I'm doing!\"\nPhase 3: Reviewing - \"I could actually do 80% of this, and most of it is cheap!\"\n\nPhase 1\n\nThe reason I went through this exercise is to experiment with breaking the habit of self-imposed constraints. We put constraints on ourselves because it's safe and we are addicted to avoiding uncertainty. For example, if you were going to choose a restaurant to eat at tonight, most people will either:\n\na) limit their choices by the *good* restaurants that they have been to before (2 constraints: have been to, and good), or\n\nb) they will limit choices by region, cuisine, price or dietary preferences.\n\nWhy do we do this?\n\n1. It's simply too hard to choose from such a large list. *Picking correctly requires logic.*\n2. It's a safer bet picking 1 in 5 instead of 1 in 500. *The stakes are too high, we might just not enjoy the meal.*\n3. If the food sucks, it couldn't be *our* fault because we chose the best we could. *We hate being wrong.*\n\nHowever consider the times when you felt on top of the world, when you achieved your best work, when you do things that are remarkable (for yourself and others). Typically, in these cases:\n\n* We use more heart than logic.\n* The stakes are high, that's why it's remarkable.\n* We could have been wrong, but we picked a winner.\n\nIn phase 1 of this exercise, I worked out that there was so much holding me back. The voice in my head was telling me to play safe, to not think of anything too crazy. Yes, this is the Lizard Brain, a concept introduced to me by Seth Godin. Its prehistoric protectionist tendencies were eating at me to make a safe bet.\n\nPhase 2\n\nOnce the initial thoughts of 'This might not work' diminished, I was enjoying thinking of all the things I would do. The fun part is putting yourself in the shoes of a billionaire or super-fast learner or super-fit athlete. Then you ask the question: 'Now that the money/money has been taken care of. What's next?'.\n\nI kept this experiment true to my personality. Am I the sort of guy who goes out and spends a million dollars at a casino? No, I morally dislike gambling and simply wouldn't do it. Would I fly first class around the world? Yes I would.\n\nPhase 3\n\nNow looking back through my list, I'm a bit surprised at how many things were relatively cheap (under $100) to complete. Which inspired some 80:20 analysis on my behalf to work out what dreams are holding back my current happiness. Let's look at a list of things that cost money vs are cheap.\n\n[Climb the harbour bridge](http://www.bridgeclimb.com/Price/standard-price/) - $436 (2 people)\n\n[Charter an aeroplane](http://www.seaplanes.com.au/menu-of-services/scenic-flights/) - $530 (2 people)\n\n[Harbour cruise](http://www.captaincook.com.au/home.asp?pageid=1661F5DD27C61DDC&destinationid=55F0AB3672931FB9&cruiseid=BEBC47A6291DC688) - $418 (Gold - 2 people)\n\n[iMax](http://www.imax.com.au/home/) - $43 (2 people)\n\nYoga x 2 - $10\n\nSwim x 2 - $8\n\nBreakfast for 2 at the cafe x 2 - $100\n\nTest ride motorbike - free\n\nBuy Motorbike - $20k\n\nNew home - $1m\n\nMacBook Pro Retina - $3500\n\nDinner on darling harbour - $150\n\nUber car rental - $30\n\nBusiness lounge - Complimentary\n\nFlight to Singapore - $7800 (2 people)\n\nDinner in Singapore - $150 (fancy-ish dinner)\n\nHotel for 2 nights - $714\n\nShopping spree in Singapore - $5000\n\nWake Boarding - $20\n\nCheap meal in Kassim - $10\n\nNight out in Singapore - $200\n\nFlight to Bangkok - $2000\n\nHotel for 1 night - $600\n\n2-hour massage - $10\n\nEat on the streets of Bangkok - $10 (for a lot of food!)\n\nShopping in Siam - $1000\n\nDinner cruise - $100\n\nJJ Markets shopping - $300\n\nShipping to Australia - $100 (lots of stuff)\n\nFlight to Sydney - $6280\n\nCreate my own weekly movie $0\n\nLaunch with family $0\n\nBlogging $0\n\n**Total weekly cost = $1,049,529**\n\nNow, there are 33 things to do on this list. Three of which are asset purchases (house, bike and MacBook Pro), that have a residual value even after purchase. Let's leave them out of the analysis.\n\nTotal weekly cost = $26,029\n\nFrom this number, we can break out the top 2 things that drive 85% of the cost:\n\nFlights - $16,080\n\nShopping - $6,300\n\nTotal weekly cost without these = $5,649 (but add $2000 for reasonable flights and $1000 total shopping)\n\n**Now, here is the insight: from my 'dream week', 26 of the 33 things could be achieved for 25% of the total cost.**\n\n**The lesson**\n\nI see that I'm holding onto the more expensive things (the things that constrain me now) as reasons for not doing almost everything else. It's time for some hacking.\n\nNext post: Hacking dreams to reality.\n\nFeel free to add your thoughts below.\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>: we limit ourselves by constraints.

If you still want to ship the project, go for 80/20.\n\nLet's pull away from projects and just talk about life. Answer these questions honestly. If your answer sounds like an excuse, try again.\n\n1.

Seth Godin cares and so should you","slug":"freelancer-or-entrepreneur-seth-godin-cares-and-so-should-you","markdown":"In my recent post [25 insights from Seth Godin’s Startup School,](http://beingremarkable.me/blog/25-insights-from-seth-godins-startup-school) my first insight was deciding whether you are a freelancer or entrepreneur. Although the difference is subtle, the impact of thinking you’re one type and acting like the other guarantees almost certain failure.\n\n### Are you a freelancer?\n\nWho hires you? If sending your protégé would result in your client being unhappy, you’re a freelancer. People hire you because you’re amazing at what you do. Perhaps they don’t have the guts to make decisions about what’s next or you are creating something new because it’s been identified as important.\n\nNow you know you’re a freelancer, recognize that you’re the centre of someone’s universe at the point when they need you, but you won’t be needed forever. Times change and whatever you’re the best at today must evolve or you won’t get a call tomorrow.\n\nIf there is too much demand for your work, you can’t hire someone just like you and share the load. People are hiring you, not them. This may even work a few times but the business will fail because the person who is being hired for their incredible work (you) is also the person who needs to sell your reputation to new clients. The endless loop of trying to find new clients to keep the payroll running will take all of your time and you won’t have any hours left to be the brilliant person that you need to be.\n\nThis may sound familiar if you are a freelancer working more than 80 hours per week.\n\nYou’ll also notice that many successful accounting and law firms typically build a brand where the client is no longer hiring ‘John Smith’ but they’re hiring Deloitte or PwC. If John was to leave and expect to charge $1000 per hour from the same clients, he’ll soon find out that they didn’t care so much about John but the ability to hide behind the name: \"But Deloitte said it was a good idea!\"\n\nThe original partners successfully transitioned from freelancers to entrepreneurs. This is rare, not many do.\n\n### What is an entrepreneur?\n\nWhere a freelancer is the singer in the act, the entrepreneur is the agent who makes it a show. A singer could be soloist, a duet or front a band, but it’s the agent who makes the action happen. The agent wants to assemble the best artists to deliver an experience to an audience she understands. If a member of the act is sick, she’ll even try step in and take their place, but she’s not the act. She has a commitment to putting on the type of show that she believes will resonate with the audience. When she fails and the audience doesn’t show up and tell their friends she looks for another audience.\n\nEntrepreneurship isn’t about you. It’s about what you create. Your art is the living organism that we call a business. It connects people with a cause and you inspire confidence in the movement when everyone doubts you. You probably do this by telling stories.\n\nSomeone once described the bi-polar ups and downs that we entrepreneurs feel as similar to a pendulum. Sometimes it feels things are positive and only getting better, then all of a sudden, the world is against us, and then it’s not again. The skill is realizing that the reality is that the pendulum is almost still to the outside world, it’s the voice inside our head that makes it swing.\n\n### Can I be both?\n\nSure, but not on the same project. But the real question is: why do you need to be both? Every freelancer and entrepreneur that I know wishes they had more time to work on their project and to be the best they can be. Perhaps you’re not sure whether your project will work. In this case, hedging your bets will only make it more risky rather than make it safer. Choose, quickly.\n\n### What about you Todd?\n\n*I've added two others categories.*\n\n**Investor** - I’m an investor in Apathco Group. I no longer show up every day and do the hard work that my team does. Three years ago, I wore every hat: sales guy, marketing guy, operations guy, admin guy...some of these I was better at than others but the business was only as good as me on my good days. The entrepreneurial pendulum impacted my business because the business was tied to my emotional wellbeing. This wasn’t fair to my team who had the passion to step up and take ownership of their work. So I took a step back and defined myself as an investor.\n\n**Entrepreneur** - I’m an entrepreneur in my latest startup Referron. There’s no salary, my equity is earned from sweat and my role has changed from designer to developer to project manager and who knows what’s next? We’re building the business to be bigger than the founders. We’re building the community for our customers but we’re not always going to be around to moderate - we'll build a team for that.\n\n**Freelancer** - When someone hires me to speak, that’s me as a freelancer. I’m trading effort for a benefit that only they could provide me. This could be money but could also be exposure to their community.\n\n**Artist** - You’re reading my art, perhaps you listen to it too? It’s only as polished as I want and when I receive feedback, it’s my choice to take it on board or not. I don’t need the world to love me or my ideas, but those who do have my heart and mind forever. Your attention is valuable and I hope that I’ve earned it. Each day that I show up, you have a choice to listen or not. I’m still showing up. As an artist, I hope that you tell your friends if you think that I’m worthy of their attention (and your credibility) too. If not, that’s okay.\n\n[Listen to the Startup School podcast in iTunes here.](https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/seth-godins-startup-school/id566985370)\n\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>In my recent post <a href=\"http://beingremarkable.me/blog/25-insights-from-seth-godins-startup-school\">25 insights from Seth Godin’s Startup School,</a> my first insight was deciding whether you are a freelancer or entrepreneur.

The skill is realizing that the reality is that the pendulum is almost still to the outside world, it’s the voice inside our head that makes it swing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"canibeboth\">Can I be both?</h3>\n\n<p>Sure, but not on the same project. But the real question is: why do you need to be both? Every freelancer and entrepreneur that I know wishes they had more time to work on their project and to be the best they can be. Perhaps you’re not sure whether your project will work. In this case, hedging your bets will only make it more risky rather than make it safer. Choose, quickly.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whataboutyoutodd\">What about you Todd?</h3>\n\n<p><em>I've added two others categories.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Investor</strong> - I’m an investor in Apathco Group. I no longer show up every day and do the hard work that my team does. Three years ago, I wore every hat: sales guy, marketing guy, operations guy, admin guy...some of these I was better at than others but the business was only as good as me on my good days. The entrepreneurial pendulum impacted my business because the business was tied to my emotional wellbeing. This wasn’t fair to my team who had the passion to step up and take ownership of their work. So I took a step back and defined myself as an investor.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Entrepreneur</strong> - I’m an entrepreneur in my latest startup Referron. There’s no salary, my equity is earned from sweat and my role has changed from designer to developer to project manager and who knows what’s next? We’re building the business to be bigger than the founders. We’re building the community for our customers but we’re not always going to be around to moderate - we'll build a team for that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Freelancer</strong> - When someone hires me to speak, that’s me as a freelancer. I’m trading effort for a benefit that only they could provide me. This could be money but could also be exposure to their community.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Artist</strong> - You’re reading my art, perhaps you listen to it too? It’s only as polished as I want and when I receive feedback, it’s my choice to take it on board or not. I don’t need the world to love me or my ideas, but those who do have my heart and mind forever. Your attention is valuable and I hope that I’ve earned it. Each day that I show up, you have a choice to listen or not. I’m still showing up. As an artist, I hope that you tell your friends if you think that I’m worthy of their attention (and your credibility) too. If not, that’s okay.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/seth-godins-startup-school/id566985370\">Listen to the Startup School podcast in iTunes here.</a></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-09-26T06:20:10.000Z","created_by":4,"updated_at":"2016-10-17T08:22:57.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2013-07-08T06:00:00.000Z","published_by":1,"amp":null},{"id":187,"uuid":"46910ac2-67f6-4c24-b7b8-def6b8dcbc88","title":"Changing Perceptions","slug":"changing-perceptions","markdown":"You could be kind to everyone you meet.

I've been connecting with people simply because I want to connect with people who have an passion in entrepreneurship, blogging, unconventional lifestyles and challenging the status quo.\n\n2012 was quite an isolated year for me. I purposely disconnected with many people to help me clarify the person who I wanted to become.

It's not something that you do to get a response from people. Being remarkable is about trust, dignity, vulnerability, love, art and connection. Here is what it means to be remarkable:\n\n* To be loved by some and hated by others, but *only*  liked by a few.\n* To be beautiful to some, ugly to others, but never boring to anyone. \n* To be simple to understand for some, difficult for others, but never confusing. \n\n### Moments of remarkability\n\n* When the psychiatrist tells the fiancé that his wife is sick, will take years to recover and that he will feel the highest of highs and lowest of lows. But he stays.\n* The wife who sees her husband cry and simply listens to him talk.\n* When the entrepreneur pitches to her tribe, listens to their feedback and ignores those on the outside who say she will fail.\n* The grandparent who overcomes their fear of technology and walks into an Apple Store, simply to connect with their grandchildren.  \n* When a parent tells their gay son/daughter that they love them unconditionality.\n* The executive who dances on the edge of failure and fires their biggest customer because they demoralised their team.\n* The student who connects a group of people who don't *fit in *with each other, gets rejected by the popular group.
