The title of this post was going to be 'I want to live in a world where…'

But I don't believe it's wishful thinking that will take me there. It's perception, acceptance and filtering.

Let's not hide, there is so much of this world that doesn't work. There is poverty in the richest and poorest countries, we're consuming more resources than we have available for our grandchildren, and political self-interest writes the rules of the game (for most).

There are numerous global problems, some more urgent than others, that we can concern ourselves with. Most people love to talk about these. They watch the news and feel it's their job to inform others, take sides and voice their opinion. Sorry, democracy isn't about your opinion, it's about what you do.

What you choose to do begins with a thought and ends when you ship your ideas as work, art, emotional labour. The goal isn't to simply have more thoughts and take the shortcut to tell everyone your opinion. No, the goal is to do something remarkable that demonstrates your beliefs about this world. We want you to create art and change other people's minds about a cause that you're passionate about. It doesn't matter if this is a commercial interest: you'e passionate about hiring out clowns to make people smile, or a social interest: protecting logging in the Amazon. In fact I don't care about your belief, I care about the remarkable experience that you create so I can share your story with others.

We have opinions and tell stories. Every day, we intersect with the world through our opinions and our stories. That's it. No matter whether it's person-to-person communication or from an organisation, you will hear someone's opinion or their story. The latter has the potential for a great conversation, the former is boring and predictable.

Opinions + actions = stories.

* We don't care what food you like. I'd love to hear about a restaurant that made you think differently about eating.
* We don't care if you believe we should better support the poor. I'd love to understand what the impact is for a child when they are supported by a program that you create.
* We don't care if your product is lighter, faster, cheaper. I'd love to know how the designers and engineers worked together to build an amazing product.

I choose to live in a world where…

- Things may not work and I will fail.
- I will be judged.
- Success is measured by the proportion of lives I change each day.
- I'm true to myself.
- Life is a series of projects, nothing is forever.
- People I love will pass on.
- I will be inspired.
- How I feel is determined by me.
- Time is not money, and there is no exchange rate where it becomes equitable.

**Perception is how my opinion becomes my art.**

**Filtering is required to eliminate opinions without stories.**

**Acceptance of failure eliminates my fear of the world judging me.**
